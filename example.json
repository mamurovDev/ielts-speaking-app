      "question": "In what ways can technology influence our daily routines?",
      "answer": "Technology has a profound influence on our daily routines, offering both advantages and challenges. On one hand, technology enhances efficiency through tools like digital calendars, reminders, and automation, helping people stay organized and save time.

      "question": "Do you think routines are more beneficial for adults or children? Why?",
      "answer": "Routines are beneficial for both adults and children, but they play different roles in each group. For children, routines provide a sense of security and help them learn discipline and time management skills. Predictable routines can also reduce anxiety and make transitions, such as moving from playtime to bedtime, smoother. For adults, routines help manage stress by organizing daily tasks and balancing work and personal life. While routines benefit both groups, they are particularly crucial for children in developing essential life skills.",

      "question": "What role does cultural background play in shaping a person's daily routines?",
      "answer": "Cultural background significantly influences a person's daily routines, as it dictates societal norms, values, and traditions. For example, in some cultures, family meals are central to daily routines, while in others, individual schedules may take precedence.

      "answer": "While routines can sometimes lead to a monotonous lifestyle if they become too rigid, they generally provide more freedom by offering structure and reducing decision fatigue.
